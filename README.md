# PyCitySchools - Analysis of 15 local schools  

* **Summary** 
    * This script is used to analyse the performance of schools in a local area based on different criteria. The basis of comparing the performance of different schools here is the obtained scores in two subjects: maths and reading and an overall passing rates in both of these subjects.
    * At first, the local government area summary is performed by analysing the total number of schools, total students, budget, individual scores in the subjects maths and reading and the passing rates for the whole local area. 
    * After that, a detailed analysis is performed in which the above mentioned parameters are calulated for each school to compare between them based on different conditions such as school size, school type, average spending per student etc. 

* **Comparison and Conclusion**
    * From the analysis, it can be seen that there are 15 schools in the local area with a total of 39170 students. It is evident from the analysis that an increase in average spending per student shows an increase in the overall passing rate of the schools only upto a certain range (630 dollars per student) after which the trend seems to be decreasing. That is, the analysis tells us that only an increase in budget spending per student may not lead to an improved overall passing rate.
    
    * Looking at the comparison of scores by school type, we can see that the independent school types are better performing compared to the government school types with an collective overall passong rate of almost 77 % compared to about 70.7 % for government schools. 
    
    * Regarding the comparison of schools by size, the small sized schools with number of students less than 1000 show a better overall passing rate compared to medium and large size schools. The difference in average overall passing rate is comparatively less with the medium size schools (about 1 point less) than the large sized schools (approximately 9 points less). This shows that the number of students may have a direct impact on the quality of education students receive.
